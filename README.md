Static Comp Challenge
---
## Objective

This project was assigned with the intent to have us build our HTML and CSS muscles! We were given a template to follow and mimic, with our own personal flair. The base layout is pictured below;

##Resources

Assets were pulled from the manga "Drifting Dragons" and edited for the purposes of the project.

##Outcome
I decided to make a kind of mini field guide using the dragons of the world of the manga. Laid out in convenient card style, they each have their own little blurb under their illustration.
